# Backlog

* Extracting the team members for each rendered task is highly inefficient
* The create_project method in views/project.py seems more like a model function. Improve.
* Set the user that is logged in as responsible for tasks when the actual 
responsible is removed from the team.
* Split models and views in multiple files.
* Consistency issues, e.g., the point counts of task lists are not updated when 
task workloads are changed.
* Show individual speed-chart.
* Add tests.
